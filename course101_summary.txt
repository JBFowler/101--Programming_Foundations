# summary for course 101

This course was instrumental in expanding my basic knowledge of ruby.  Coming into the course I had a fair grasp on how programming worked, but did not have any prior programming experience.  This course walked me through a challenging but progressive way of learning the fundamentals, and the perfectly executed on expanding the topics I had already learned.  I feel that I have retained the concepts very well, and the constant ready of ruby-docs has really helped in my understanding of what the language is capable of and what is at my disposal.  I liked how we were introduced to handy but rarely used methods throughout the games we created.  I loved learning things like the '*' symbol in front of an array that would essentially call each on the array and run through it all, as well as '<<-' that' allowed us to write a whole group of 'puts' lines in one variable.  There wasn't anything specific that I did not like.  The toughest parts were the hard exercises from lesson 3 and the bonus features on the tic tac toe game and rps game.  I have yet to try the algorithm on the tic tac toe game but will do that in my spare time.  The easiest parts were the exercises from the book, but they were great refreshers on what you had just learned.  Overall I really enjoyed the course and feel that I have taken a lot of it with me.
